<h1>The Best Movies According to Faraaz</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Burnt:</h3>
<p>This movie is all about the intensity and passion about cooking the best food and to become the 3 star michilin chef. Amazing acting by the protagonist Bradley Cooper. Every few months, i go back to watch this movie.</p>

<h3>Interstellar:</h3>
<p>This movie is close to my heart. It is a story about how much sacrifice human race can make to save the family. It's a sad movie that shows the emotions between the father and the daughter. I will always have regret of not watching the movie in theatres, because it was infront of me and i ignored the movie to watch in big screen. <br />

  Anne Hathaway <br/>
  Jessica Chastain <br />

<h3>Blade Runner 2049:</h3>
<p>This is a movie which made me think. The society without God. The society so advanced that the loneliness is grave. The human contact and connection with each other is lost. People preferring technology and AI girlfriend instead of real humans. The background scores were beautiful.This movie takes you into a journey to the future which is empty and souless.</p>
